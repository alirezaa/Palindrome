Readme for Palindrome program
------------------------------
This program has a function that determines if a given
string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is
spelled exactly the same forwards or backwards, like "pop" or
"Ah, Satan sees Natasha". This program ignores all
non-alphanumeric characters and assumes that upper-and lower-case
characters are identical. The function outputs whether or not
the string is a palindrome and return a boolean.
